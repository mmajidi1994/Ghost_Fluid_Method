# Ghost fluid method for the simulation of multimedium compressible flow (1D)
The code is to simulate compressible multiphase flows in cartesian, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates with a GFM-based algorithm. 
Different spatial discretizations in cylindrical/spherical coordinates with cylindrical/spherical symmetry using finite volume WENO.
